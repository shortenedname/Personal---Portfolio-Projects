# Personal & Portfolio Projects

This is where I'll put all my personal projects and tinkering and thigns that I'm working or have worked on.
Most of it is in python but not all.
Maybe a large chunk will be done in Jupyter Notebooks becasue I really find it convenient. (that VSCode extension is noice)
Probably not though, I should build a habit doing it from "scratch"
